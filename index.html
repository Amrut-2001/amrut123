    <p style="color: white;">
        September 15 is marked as the birthday of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya (1861-1962), credited for his role as a civil engineer and administrator in colonial India.

Born on September 15, 1861, in the Muddenahalli village of Karnataka, ​​Visvesvaraya completed his school education in his hometown and later on went to study Bachelor of Arts at the University of Madras. He then pursued a diploma in civil engineering at the College of Science in Pune. Having played a role in major public works projects across the nation, he later served as the 19th Dewan of Mysore and wrote two books on the Indian economy. Here is a look at his life and his legacy.

    <h1 style="color: azure;background-color: black;">Why Is National Engineers' Day Celebrated On September 15?</h1>
    <p style="color: white">
        National Engineers' Day is celebrated on September 15 to honor the birth anniversary of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, born in 1861. Sir Visvesvaraya was not only an outstanding engineer but also a visionary statesman. He made remarkable contributions to the fields of engineering, irrigation, and infrastructure, leaving an indelible mark on India's development. Sir Visvesvaraya's pioneering work in irrigation engineering, particularly the design and construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara dam in Karnataka, stands as a testament to his engineering prowess. His innovations greatly contributed to the prosperity of the region by enhancing the water supply for agriculture and promoting economic growth. In recognition of his exceptional contributions, Sir Visvesvaraya was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, in 1955. His dedication to engineering excellence and nation-building continues to inspire generations of engineers.

    <p style="color: white;">
        M. Visvesvaraya was born on 15 September 1861 at Muddenahalli, Kingdom of Mysore (in present-day Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka) to Mokshagundam Srinivasa Shastry and Venkatalakshmi.[9] His ancestors hail from Mokshagundam, a village in present-day Andhra Pradesh, and had migrated to the kingdom years prior to Visvesvaraya's birth.[10][11][12]

Visvesvaraya received his primary education in Bangalore and earned a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the University of Madras. He later studied at the College of Engineering, Pune (then College of Science at the University of Bombay) and graduated as an engineer, receiving Diploma in Civil Engineering (DCE).[13] It was here that he became a member of the Deccan Club and was its first secretary; he would therefore have been well-acquainted with the progressives in Pune, including Sir R. G. Bhandarkar, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, who were all members of the club.[14]
